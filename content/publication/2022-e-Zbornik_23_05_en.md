abstract = "This paper is a continuation of the research on the influence of different modeling of the subgrade reaction coefficient on the selected static system. This paper analyzes the behavior of a two-story reinforced concrete frame for different foundation dimensions and different values of the subgrade reaction coefficient. It presents an overview of values of these coefficients, which represent the stiffness of Winkler springs with respect to the specific geometry of shallow foundations. The values are different depending on the author, and the average value was used as relevant for comparison. Results of the numerical analysis for an individual reinforced concrete two-story frame were obtained using the SE_Calc and Tower 8 programs. After obtaining the results for each individual frame, they were combined and analyzed."
