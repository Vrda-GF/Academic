abstract = "The aim of this paper is to show the influence of the subgrade reaction coefficient modelling on the simple 3D frame subjected to horizontal symmetrical static load. Since the work represents a continuation of the research on this topic, it was decided that the construction, in this case too, was built on the square foundations on granular soil. Different values of subgrade reaction coefficient obtained for the square foundation are the consequence of using different expressions defined by individual authors. Thus, one diagram shows each author’s relation between the width of the foundations and the value of the subgrade reaction coefficient. The response of the characteristic structural framework additionally loaded with horizontal static force is then described further in the paper."
