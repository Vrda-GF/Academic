abstract = "During the structural construction on the distant locations, it is necessary to make the foundation with as little ground impact as possible. One of the usual choices is the wood grid construction on the shallow concrete foundations. To define the connection between the soil and foundation, it is necessary to find out the subgrade reaction coefficient. Many authors worked on that problem which in its essence represents the behaviour of the ground, the relation between the stress under the foundation and displacement of the settlement. The paper shows the effects of different modelling of the soil reaction coefficient on the wood grid structure. The structural response is represented in a worked-out example."
