abstract = "In numerical modeling of structures, it is necessary to model the soil on which the structures rest. This soil simulation is performed through the Winkler springs model. In the simplest case of shallow foundations, this is done through the coefficient of soil reaction. Since a large number of authors have dealt with this topic, for the needs of a more reliable modeling, the SE_Calc software solution has been developed. The subgrade reaction is calculated on the templates of several authors in order to graphically display their relationships."
