abstract = "The paper presents the influence of the soil reaction coefficient modeling on the 2D frame behavior. The foundations are square and the ground is granular. Different authors perform different expressions for values of the soil reaction coefficient. So, for each of these coefficients, a 2D frame was calculated using the Tower 3D Model Builder program package. In the next step the average value of the soil reaction coefficient is obtained by the SE_Calc software. Then the dimensions of the foundation were corrected in the way to obtain the same response value of the reaction coefficient for each author. The consequences of the both approaches on the behavior of the 2D frame are shown."
