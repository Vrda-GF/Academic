abstract = "This paper presents a brief overview of fractals and some possible applications of fractal geometry in architecture and civil engineering. The interest in this mathematical discipline has been steadily growing since the end of the 20th century, due to the fascinating beauty of fractals as well as the generally accepted perception that many shapes in nature, if not all, are irregular and rugged, or chaotic (nature is fractal). Fractal geometry, in contrast to Euclidean geometry, offers considerably better methods for describing natural objects, and thereby for achieving harmony with nature, or harmony between clear precision and chaotic imperfection."
