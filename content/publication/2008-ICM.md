abstract = "Beginning with the functionality to provide resources, one of the most immediately obvious strengths of learning portals in a converging environment is the educational potential to provide immediately up–to–date resources to large number of learners easily and relatively cheaply (whether one is using the Web or e–mail technologies). In the last several years, learning portals have become very popular, and today there exists a rich offer of learning contents on the Web, for almost all subjects (areas) in various languages, primarily thanks to the rapid evolution of information and communication technologies (ICT). The idea, which led to this paper, is aimed in the direction to present an example of a learning portal for the teaching of mathematics at elementary and secondary level – MATHEMATICS ONLINE, made as a part of a three–year project, which was initiated in October, 2004 year, in organization with JICA (Japanese International Cooperation Agency), CRICED (Center for Research on International Cooperation In Educational Development) office at University of Tsukuba and state of Bosnia & Herzegovina."
