abstract = "Computer-based learning has been widely used in engineering education and a large number of research, studies and reports, regarding its usage and effectiveness have been accessed broadly. The software solution, known as CARBONARA (Computer Aided Research Boosts Optimization, Numerical and Regression Analysis), which covers a few branches of mathematics that are essential for engineering education, has been proposed for development. There will be three modules, each containing several submodules, within CARBONARA software, and all will be implemented in the object-oriented programming language C#, within Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 software package. This article aims to present one of the developed submodules in the current solution, Curve Fitting, but also to propose a new approach by which lecturers might incorporate computer-aided research into their statistics and/or applied mathematics courses, and transform the learning experiences of their students."
