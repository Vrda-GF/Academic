abstract = "The software solution, that allowing users, students and engineers, to easily determine the values of the soil reaction coefficient (the coefficient of subgrade reaction) and buckling coefficient, has been developed. These are four modules within SE_Calc software, two have been implemented in the object–oriented programming language C#, within Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 software package, and another two have been implemented as Flash solutions. The aim of this paper is to determine the significance of the influence of the use of SE_Calc software on acquiring students’ knowledge of soil reaction and buckling, as well as their reactions to learning by the use of computer teaching methods. It has been intended to obtain a clear insight of the benefits of computer–aided teaching in a specific area of engineering education."
