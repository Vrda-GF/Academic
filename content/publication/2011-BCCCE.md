abstract = "A new and advanced visualization for polynomial regression data fit is presented. The visualization based on Flash - an advanced multimedia authoring and development environment for creating animations and interactive applications inside Web pages - willpresent a model for better understanding of curve fitting. This model ensures to engineering students, as well as other researchers, an interactive explanations which helps them to achieve some main learning goals: how the range and uncertainty and number of data points affect correlation coefficient, or how correlation coefficient and chi squared can be used to indicate how well a curve describes the data relationship. Another objective of this paper is to explore the ways to enhance motivational impact and outcomes of such Web - based learning activities."
