abstract = "The objective of this paper is to report my educational research project based on the advantage of learning and teaching with ICT, focusing on teaching of complex numbers. Some examples of motivational impacts of ICT existed already within a wide literature on educational uses and outcomes of ICT in classrooms, as well as out of school settings. The project was designed to build on such models and investigate the issues in more detail, and to explore ways to enhance motivational impacts and outcomes."
