abstract = "The paper analyzes the educational-research project based on the preferabilities of the teaching process and learning mathematics using ICT tools, which focuses on the teaching of complex numbers and interactive geometry. Some examples of analysis of the motivation and impact of ICT already exist within the wider literature concerning the educational outcomes and the potential use of ICT in classrooms and in extracurricular activities. This work is designed with the aim to explore the possibilities of implementing such models in the teaching of mathematics and more to explain the results of their use, and ways to enhance motivation for learning and learning outcomes."
